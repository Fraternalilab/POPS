Dear everyone,

Following the EBI guideline, we are migrating all the Git repositories of FunPDBe from GitHub to EBI-hosted GitLab:
https://gitlab.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe-kb/funpdbe

Please update your remotes for the FunPDBe client, or re-clone "git@gitlabci.ebi.ac.uk:pdbe-kb/funpdbe/funpdbe-client.git" to continue using the deposition client.

We also have a new tool you can use to validate your FunPDBe JSONs - it performs all the validation steps that the client and deposition system does, so you can validate against the complete deposition process. (The FunPDBe client --mode=validate option only performs the client-side validations). The validator is available at:
https://gitlab.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe-kb/funpdbe/funpdbe-validator

Sincerely,
Mihaly/Misi

Subject: FunPDBe deposition client and app ready for testing
To: Franca Fraternali <franca.fraternali@googlemail.com>


Dear Franca,

The FunPDBe deposition system is ready for external testing. Could you please do the following:
* Prepare and send us a sample JSON file for your data, that follows the JSON specification (an example is at https://github.com/funpdbe-consortium/funpdbe_schema/blob/master/funpdbe_example.json)
* Download the FunPDBe deposition client from https://github.com/funpdbe-consortium/funpdbe-client and try to submit your JSON using this client

For the purpose of testing, your username is test-popscomp and the password is funpdbe-test

An example of using the client is provided in the README.md file, but I also copy it here:

If you had a file with your data for PDB entry 1CBS, you could run the following:
./funpdbe_client.py --user=test_popscomp --pwd=funpdbe-test --mode=post --path=path/to/your/json/file.json --resource=popscomp

This would validate your JSON file and if it is valid, it would deposit it in FunPDBe.

Another thing that might be userful is to run:
./funpdbe_client.py --mode=validate --path=path/to/your/json/file.json

This would validate your JSON so you will know if something is not okay with your format.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you need help, clarifications or have suggestions,
Kind regards,
Misi
